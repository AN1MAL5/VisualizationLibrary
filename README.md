**WARNING: this is a development version lacking many of the improvements made in v1.0.0 onward, please use the [latest release](https://github.com/MicBosi/visualizationlibrary/releases/).**

Visualization Library is released under the OSI approved Simplified BSD License ([LICENSE.TXT](LICENSE.TXT)).

Visualization Library is a C++ middleware for high-performance 2D and 3D graphics applications based on the industry standard OpenGL 1.x-4.x, designed to develop portable applications for the Windows, Linux and Mac OS X operating systems.

## About v2.0

This marks the official come back of Visualization Library in maintenance mode. This means that [I](https://michelebosi.com) will do my best to more actively maintain the website, accept patches, fix bugs, improve OpenGL support among other things. No new big features are planned at the moment.

* Objectives for v2.0:
    * Keep Visualization Library completely free for open source as well as commercial applications.
    * Focus on improving upon VL current strenghts.
    * Fully embrace GitHub as VL official repository.
        * Releses and downloads will be based on GitHub tools.
        * Only source releases will be done, no binaries, no precompiled html or chm documentation.
        * [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/MicBosi/visualizationlibrary/issues) will be the official place where to report bugs, issues and request features.
        * Encourage collaboration and patch submission via GitHub.
    * Introduce the new [Visualization Library Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/visualization-library) which replaces the [legacy forums](http://visualizationlibrary.org/forum).
    * Qt5: full support as first class citizen.
    * GUI backends update: support latest stable version, Qt 4, SDL and wxWidgets in primis.
    * Third party libs update: support latest stable version of FreeType, zlib, libjpeg, libpng, libtiff, GDCM.
    * Low level VL: improve VL usefulness as a low level "drop in" replacement for raw OpenGL with examples and necessary fixes.
    * Review support to latest OpenGL 4.x version: support new features/definitions that are easy to implement.
    * Improve documentation: how to compile VL, low level VL usage, improved VL architecture and building blocks documentation.
    * Fix compatibility issues and tests.
    * Making VL more accessible to computer graphics beginners.
    * Investigate JavaScript and Python bindings.
